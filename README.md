# Portfolio Return Simulator
 A project built in Python that allows input of assets and weights for constructing an equities' portfolio (stocks, ETFs, etc.). Furthermore, we built a heatmap to see the correlation matrix between the portfolio's assets.
## Disclaimer
- There's some limitations: can't input treasuries, and are only able to input long positions in futures and other derivatives.
