# Portfolio Return Simulator
 A project built in Python that allows input of assets and weights for constructing an equities' portfolio (stocks, ETFs, etc.).
## Disclaimer
- There's some limitations: can't input treasuries, and are only able to input long positions in futures and other derivatives.
- In the .ipynb, there's already a portfolio in the line chart. That one is composed by the following stocks: LREN3.SA (20%), BBAS3.SA (20%), SEDG (40%) and BNS (20%)
